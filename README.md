## Bioinformatics

This notebook explores a diabetes dataset, performing exploratory data analysis.

As an interdisciplinary field that utilises software tools to analyse biological data, bioinformatics has emerged as a crucial tool in developing insights, specifically into larger datasets that have become more numerous with the development of computer storage, processing power and means of collecting and analysing data across the fields of biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, mathematics and statistics.

Some of the most noteworthy examples of bioinformatics exist in the field of genomics, where DNA sequencing has created wide ranging implications for the study of disease, human health and longevity.
